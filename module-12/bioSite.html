                        Golf incorporates an extensive list of the characteristics one would look for from a hobby including being able to play solo or in a group, get good exercise, get progressively better, meet influential people in your community, watch it on tv, play competitively or for fun and even get a golf vacation in the sun during the winter. 
                        Golf is one of the largest sports in the world and whatever your level, golf can be become a major part of your life if you take a shine to the game and you can enjoy as little or as much as you want. 
                        I have enjoyed the challenge of golf. In my opinion it is the hardest sport mentally to play. I can drink and have fun or play seriously.

                        Working out for me is a stress reliever. What motivates me to go is not only to stay fit, but it makes me feel good physically.
                        Watching myself grow physically lets me know I have worked hard no matter if the goal is met.

                        I don't think I'll ever grow out of playing video games lol. I enjoy playing RPG games like demon souls because of the challenge.
                        Gaming results in dopamine secretion, which makes you feel good. Video games present a challenge and reward you for overcoming it, which leads to feelings of competence. 
                        Gaming can create a flow state, which is similar to meditation.

                        As an industrial electrical engineer, your responsibilities revolve around the design and development of electrical power systems for industrial construction projects. 
My duties were to draw a design to the proper specifications, supervise electrical personnel onsite, prepare equipment usage schedules, train and communicate with staff, and support other electrical engineers. 
I also had troubleshoot control panels in existing power systems and evaluate the project to ensure all construction is compliant with current electrical codes and specifications.
